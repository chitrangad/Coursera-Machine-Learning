# Coursera-Machine-Learning
## Repository for Practical Machine Learning Final Project

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. YThe repo has a report describing how the model was buit, how cross validation was used, expected out of sample error and why the model was selected. The project uses prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
